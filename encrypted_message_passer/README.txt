This is a encrypted message passer based on an assignment for my cybersecurity class
The two test programs encrypt a message and decrypt a message respectively.
the server and client can be run completely separately and just passing encrypted files.
It also has a password login system where users can be added and verified.
still need to implement requiring log in to send messages/identify sender
